            <h2>Pool A</h2>
            <p>Beating <em>both</em> Ireland and Scotland, the Japanese finished the biggest upset of the tournament so far. With the amazing support of their home crowd, they managed to win all four of their pool matches and advance to the quarterfinal from the first place seat.</p>

            <p>With Japan's surprise domination, only one other could advance, and after a fierce deciding battle between the two islander teams, <strong>Ireland</strong> secured the second quarterfinal spot of pool A.</p>

            <h2>Pool B</h2>
            <p>No surprises here as New Zealand easily claims the first place. With a record <em>fifty seven</em> pool matches without a loss, the All Blacks continue their breeze through the world cup group stages.</p>

            <p>They are joined by South Africa, who beat Italy, Namibia and Canada for their chance to win the trophy.</p>

            <h2>Pool C</h2>
            <p>Often dubbed the <cite>pool of death</cite>, pool C saw some of the closest matches of the whole tournament. In the end, England and France emerged victorious and will continue to fight in the elimination matches.</p>

            <p>The USA, disappointed, finish the tournament without a single win and will have to wait for their shot next year.</p>
